# C++ Programming Practice

This repository contains my journey of learning and practicing C++ programming language. It includes various programs and problem solutions implemented in C++.

## Contents

- Basic C++ programs
- Control flow examples (`a.cpp`, `b.cpp`)
- Input/output operations (`main.cpp`)
- Problem-solving exercises

## Code Examples

- Age verification program (`b.cpp`)
- Grade calculation system (`a.cpp`)
- Character input demo (`main.cpp`)

## Development Environment

- Language: C/C++
- Compiler: Clang (macOS)
- IDE: Visual Studio Code
- Platform: macOS (ARM64)

## Build and Run

To compile and run any program:

```bash
clang++ program_name.cpp -o program_name
./program_name
```

## Learning Topics

- Basic syntax and data type
- Control structure (if-else, switch)
- Input/Output operations
- Problem-solving techniques
